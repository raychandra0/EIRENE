# Rules for the Changelog

- Add new entries at the top of the file
- Include Author, branch and last commit sha-1 hash
- Include the last EIRENE release version the development is based on
- The commit sha-1 hash is obviously not known at the time of the commit, so best practice is to add an additional commit just including an update to the CHANGELOG.md file. This commit can then reference the previous commits sha-1 hash.
- Include list of changes with short description
- If test cases were updated describe the necessity and the amount by which results have changed

## P. Boerner - PB/bugfixes_and_improvements - 9744e33a0f57c55dc11725a6df83013e909e16bb

### Based on V1.1.0 (develop - 549f0660027fa64b28fb59d11ba951d6759f5f5e)

** Changes **

- In subroutine DBG_PRINTOUT use correct dimensions NPLSTI and NPLSV when calculating averages of TIIN, VXIN, VYIN, VZIN as those are the species limits of these tallies.
- In time-dependent calculations it is necessary to rescale the flux stored on the time boundary when changing the timestep. The rescaled flux needs to be used for FLXCEN as well.
- Set FLXCEN to rescaled flux when changing timestep size in time-dependent mode.
- In EIRENE_OUTFLX for triangular meshes not based on an underlying structured grid printing of spatially resolved surface tallies was not done correctly. This issue has been fixed.
- Additionally an option to order the triangle faces belonging to one spatially resolved surface into a continuous surface has been added (NFLAGS > 10). A table holding information such as coordinates of the start and endpoints of the triangle faces, the arc length along the surface and the surface tally for all requested species will be printed. Produce a sorted list of triangle edges for spatially resolved surfaces and use it in the output
- For triangular meshes the NFLAGS flag has been extended. Here NFLAGS > 10 triggers the production of an additional table holding information about the spatially resolved surface namely start and end points of the triangle edges forming the surface, the arc length along the surface and the values of the surface tally for the requested species.

#### Based on Vx.y.z (undefined before this commit - use instead develop - d3033c4626f220acfb060aecc8c29c523b8f4d4c)

**Description**

- CI checks (compare scrips) were switched off and CI signaled 'green' even though the output has changed ([issue #82](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/eirene/eirene/-/issues/82))
- The checks were switched off by commits 40a86ae38b0eeb860f7f4553a15ade890749f3f3 (2021-10-14) and 28ba4aa745452a67b75d6836c1e60aefa061af20 (2022-12-14)
- Fixed compare scripts to flag differences to reference output
- Updated standard test cases
- **IMPORTANT!!! NEW TEST CASES WERE NOT YET VALIDATED !!!**

**Changes in EIRENE Database since compare error was introduced in  40a86ae38b0eeb860f7f4553a15ade890749f3f3**

**Differences of new test cases generated**

- fort.37 generated by eirmod.infcop was abandoned (ecdedfcbb9d2f9a105462ead067205e38b5bc421).

  - The output to fort.37 was moved to the general EIRENE output file (IUNOUT)
  - Removed fort.37 from reference cases

- Differences in standard output file of EIRENE

  - The maximum number of ATOMIC and molecular reaction has increased by one (NREAC)
    - Affected test cases: 1D-H_slab, 1D_cylindric, 1D-elliptic, 2D-D_slab, 2D-D_slab_finite_cylinder_11x11,  2D-D_triang, 2D_cylindric, 2D_elliptic, 3D_slab_11x11x11,  ALTS2,  ALTS2_bits, cylinder, cylinder_triang_no_octree,  cylinder_triang_octree
    - Test cases not affected:  2D-D_polygon, 2D-D_polygon_NLPLG
  - Some test cases are signalling IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO
    - 2D-D_polygon, 2D-D_polygon_NLPLG
  - Some test cases are **NOT** signalling any more IEEE_INVALID_FLAG
    - cylinder
  - CREACD changed significantly
    - 2D-D_polygon,  2D-D_slab,  2D-D_slab_finite_cylinder_11x11,  2D-D_triang,  3D_slab_11x11x11,  3D-D_tetra,  3D-D_tetra
  - TABEI1 (AVR) changed significantly
    - 2D-D_polygon
  - EELEI1 (AVR) changes slightly
    - 2D-D_polygon_NLPLG
  - More warnings from SLREAC extrapolation
    - 2D-D_slab_finite_cylinder_11x11, 2D-D_triang, 3D_slab_11x11x11,  3D-D_tetra,

- **All EMC3 test cases are identical**

  - They have limited precision in their ASCII outputs

- Even though these testcases show differences, their global balances in standard output of EIRENE show no differences -> **OK to update these test cases**

  - 1D_cylindric, 1D_elliptic, 1D-H_slab, 2D_cylindric, cylinder, ITER_1573, ITER_1573_def_lines, ITER_1573_dens_model, ITER_1573_scaling, ALT2S, 2D-D_polygon_NLPLG, 2D_elliptic, ALT2S_bits

  - ITER test cases show differences due to neutral-neutral collisions in the IN-TALLIES

- These test cases show differences with the new EIRENE database, but they show no differences in their global balances with the old EIRENE database -> **OK to update test cases**

  - 2D-D_slab_finite_cylinder_11x11, 3D-D_tetra, 2D-D_polygon, 3D-D_slab_11x11x11

- These test cases show differences with the new and the old EIRENE Database. **Reasson for changes needs still to be undestood, not OK to update**

  - 2D-D_triang, cylinder_triang_no_octree, cylinder_triang_octree

  - 2D-D_slab: Shows only some small differences in global balances with old database !!!
